# Task 7 – Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions 🧩

## 🔐 Cyber Security Internship Task

### 🎯 Objective:
To identify and remove any potentially harmful or suspicious browser extensions and understand how such extensions can pose risks to user privacy and security.

---

## 🧠 What I Did:

1. Opened `chrome://extensions` to view all installed extensions.
2. Reviewed each extension's permissions, developer source, and necessity.
3. Found and removed a suspicious extension:
   - **Name:** Video Downloader Professional
   - **Reason for Removal:** Required high permissions, not from a well-known developer, potential privacy/security risks.
4. Captured before and after screenshots for documentation.
5. Restarted the browser and confirmed improved extension hygiene.
